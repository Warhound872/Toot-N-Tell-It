    <p> Toot "N" Tell It was founded in 1950s and got its name from when you could drive up, honk your horn, the car hop would come out and take your order, and bring it out to you when it was ready. The ownership of the business has traded hands in more recent years to the new owner, Carolyn Zimmerman, who owns the restaurant today. Though Toot “N” Tell It has changed over the years, we have a long proud history here in Dyer, TN, and we have no plans on leaving any time soon.
